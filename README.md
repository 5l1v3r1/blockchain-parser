Blockchain parser
=================

**Author:** Denis Leonov (<466611@gmail.com>)

Simple script for parsing **blkXXXXX.dat** files of Bitcoin blockchain database.

This script also compatible with most of altcoins, after making some tiny tricks.

**The one realisation of blockchain parser that allows you to explore the main database as close as possible.**

Don't worry to email me your questions or suggestions about this parser.

No dependencies, no third-parties modules or libs needed. Just install Python 3.6 or 2.7 standart release and run.

Make sure you change the paths for **blkXXXXX.dat** files and for the parsing results to yours. The script works only with fully downloaded blockchain **dat** files (that are ~134Mb).

This script convert the full blockchain raw database that is stored in **blkXXXXX.dat** files to the simple **txt** view.

**If this was helpfull for you, don't hesistate to make a donations!!!**
