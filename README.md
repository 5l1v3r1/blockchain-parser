#Blockchain parser

Simple script for parsing Bitcoin and altcoins blockchain.

No dependencies. Just install Python 2.7 standart release and run.

The hash of the blocks and transactions for altcoins is different from bitcoin, so these calculations will be added in the near future. May be.

Also soon can be added blockchain verifier script.

This code written for author's educational purposes, so there is no goals to the fast parsing time. But this code can make you better understand what is blockchain.

Donations can clarify the growth of this code with zero or positive increment, or vice versa :)
